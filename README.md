Description:

1 - Usage of Open CV and Haarcascades in our project, the xml files are publicaly available.
2 - Dataset of 5 unique pakistani faces of multiple features have been extracted from web (manually) more than 70-100 images of Single character mostly cleaned dataset.

@Haniahasan1:

Description:

1 - I have created dataset in which I have 5 different characteristics images after extracting them I have done data cleaning and got cropped images

@hafsashahab1:

Description:

1 - as of now I have created 5 datasets each consist of 5 different character's images. After extracting the images manually from internet I did some cleaning.

Description:

1 - Feature vectors X and labels y are converted into numpy arrays for model training. The data is split into training and testing sets, and an SVM with an RBF kernel is trained and evaluated, To identify the optimal model, GridSearchCV is used to compare SVM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression classifiers with various parameters. Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to analyze performance. Finally, the best model and the class dictionary are saved for future use.

@Haniahasan1:

Description:

1 - Feature engineering applied on the final dataset, Use of wavelet transform as a feature for training our model. We will use these raw images along with wavelet transformed images to train our classifier. Preparation of X and y now, our data cleaning process is done.

@hafsashahab1:

Description:

1 - In this Phase after gathering data and making clean datasets Of more characters I used Python in a Jupyter Notebook to automatically crop multiple image folders simultaneously. My script iterates through each folder, identifies images, and applies cropping using predefined parameters and with help of libraries like OpenCV.
